# landing-page

A project to create a basic landing with dummy data and placeholder images to showcase basic HTML and CSS layout skills.

Project doesn't use anything other than basic HTML and some CSS styling with special focus on flex box.

The project was initially completed on my first run through The Odin Project however after 6 months of initial completion I have revisited the project
and made it look better thanks to my more advanced knowledge of front-end development. 

The live demo for the project can be viewed by clicking [here.](https://ashish-krishna-k.github.io/landing-page/)
